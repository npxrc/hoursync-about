				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					I work with Creative Cloud software and Autodesk software,
					such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Revit, and Civil 3D, to name
					a few.
					<br />
					<br />
					On the side, I do software development and web design. I
					work primarily with HTML/CSS but have used C# WinUI 3 to
					make a few apps. I've also played the violin for 5 years and
					I played the piano for 7 years.
					<br />
					<br />
					My software development career began during COVID-19, when I
					was bored. So I decided to learn HTML (web structure) and
					some CSS (web styling). Atom by GitHub was my first app I
					learned to code in because of a tutorial on YouTube. I
					learned CSS through

						>this Jake Wright tutorial playlist.</a
					>
					I also remember using Autocode (now defunct) to host my
					school's Robotics Club website, and the layout was... maybe
					a bit similar to the Jake Wright tutorial... anyways.
					<br />
					<br />
					Below are some of the projects that I have worked on.
